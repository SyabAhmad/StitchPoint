            At Naqsh Couture we believe clothing is more than fabric and thread
            ‚Äî it‚Äôs memory, confidence, and identity. For over a decade we‚Äôve
            partnered with discerning clients to create garments that celebrate
            life‚Äôs most meaningful moments. From a bride‚Äôs first step down the
            aisle to a tailored suit that changes a boardroom conversation, each
            creation is made with intention, heart, and exacting craft.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our atelier blends traditional handwork and modern techniques. Every
            seam, every stitch, every thoughtful detail is an invitation ‚Äî to
            feel exceptional, to be remembered, to hold a piece of art that fits
            your life. We‚Äôre meticulous because you deserve garments that last
            and stories that become heirlooms.

            <p>
              Founded by Sarah Khan, a passionate designer with roots in
              traditional craftsmanship, Naqsh Couture began as a dream to
              bridge the gap between heritage and modernity. Sarah's journey
              started in her grandmother's workshop, learning the art of
              embroidery that has been passed down through generations. Today,
              she leads a team of skilled artisans who share her vision of
              creating timeless pieces that tell unique stories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every garment we create is a collaboration between you and our
              team. We listen to your dreams, understand your lifestyle, and
              craft pieces that not only look beautiful but feel like an
              extension of your personality. Our clients aren't just
              customers‚Äîthey're part of our extended family.
